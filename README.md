# TTT-API
This script was created for the Dialogue Systems 2 course at the University of Gothenburg in 2022.
It is a very simple script intended for extracting information about the edibility of certain plants from [The Tortoise Table](https://www.thetortoisetable.org.uk/index.php#.Yzb1MXZBzD4). It contains one function, get_plant_dict(), which returns a dictionary of plants matching the input string; each plant's value is another dictionary containing their edibility and latin name. Alternative names are not featured, nor are the details as to why the plant is edible or not. In case no match is found, the dictionary is returned empty.
